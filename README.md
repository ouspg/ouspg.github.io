## Modifying top banner

Modify the file `config/_default/languages.en.toml` to change the contents of the banner, or disable it.

Sample configuration:

```toml
notification1 = { enabled = true, info_full = "Go check this wonderful search engine!", info_short = "Here is Google.", url = "https://google.com" }
```
