Many of our courses are using similar practicalities and concepts how they will be arranged.
You will find the common information here.

The most of the courses are utilising GitHub for sharing the exercise assigments and also as return platform (GitHub Classroom).
Exercises itself require often the use of multiple different operating systems, e.g. Windows and different Linux distributions, and brief overview how to get them locally in physical laboratory classes or remotely, is introduced here.

## Contact channels

At the moment, courses are using single [**Slack Worskpace**](https://compsec-unioulu.slack.com/) as primary contact and discussion channel for teaching purposes.
You can join there with your `*.oulu.fi`  email address.
