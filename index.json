In most cases, the required system will be Linux-based, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, some steps are required.\nWe provide up-to-date and suitable virtual machines for the courses with all the required tools installed. If you have enough disk space and performance on your computer to use them, this might be the most convenient way for Windows users.\nIf you are a brave soul, you can install tools by yourself.\nProvided virtual machines # Global download links for pre-configured virtual machines can be found on the corresponding courses\u0026rsquo; Moodle page. These virtual machines are also located on the University network drive and can be accessed either locally from the classroom or with VPN.\nOperating system Description Courses Credentials Kali Linux Official Kali with extra packages Computer Security kali:kali ChipWhisperer (Jupyter) Use ChipWhisperer on Jupyter Notebook Computer Security vagrant:vagrant Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Ubuntu with only required tools Cryptographic Systems and Weaknesses crypto:crypto Arch Linux (with Black Arch repos) Minimal distribution, good documentation, any tool can be easily installed Any arch:arch Classroom-specific instructions # These instructions apply to (TS135/TS137) or any computer with VMware or Virtualbox hypervisor installed. You must be on the University premises and can access to laboratory computer which has a hypervisor installed.\nAccessing the network drive # Mount network drive by using PowerShell (If the domain \u0026lsquo;kaappi\u0026rsquo; is not found, you can use \u0026ldquo;\\cifs.isi.oulu.fi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026rdquo;)\nNew-PSDrive -Persist -Name \u0026#34;Z\u0026#34; -PSProvider \u0026#34;FileSystem\u0026#34; -Root \u0026#34;\\\\kaappi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; You should be able to find the new Z: drive named as Virtuaalikoneet$ by using File Explorer. In the Z:\\VMware, you will find virtual machines from the CyberSpecialisation folder.\nRunning the machines # You can mount the network drive as above. Copy the selected virtual machine to C:\\Temp folder. When the virtual machine asks if you have copied or moved the machine, press \u0026ldquo;I copied it\u0026rdquo;.\nGetting virtual machines over Eduroam (University WLAN) # You can mount the network drive into your PC if it has been connected to Eduroam.\nAfter you have successfully connected to the network, you can mount the network drive as follows. If any credentials are asked, the username is username@student.oulu.fi\nWindows # Open Windows cmd:\nnet use z: \u0026#34;\\\\kaappi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; The drive should be mounted after giving correct credentials. If the domain kaappi is not found, try to use the following instead:\nnet use z: \u0026#34;\\\\cifs.isi.oulu.fi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; Linux (Debian - based) # If you have mnt folder in the root directory, and package cifs-utils is installed, you can:\nsudo mount -t cifs //kaappi/Virtuaalikoneet$ /mnt/ -o user=username@student.oulu.fi Depending on your version, you might need to play with \u0026lsquo;sec\u0026rsquo; -variable, for example, Ubuntu 16.04 might require:\nsudo mount -t cifs //kaappi/Virtuaalikoneet$ /mnt/ -o user=username@student.oulu.fi,sec=ntlm Passwords should be prompted.\nVirtual machines are located in the Virtuaalikoneet$ drive.\nGetting virtual machines with VPN # If direct download URLs are not functioning for any reason and if you are not able to get into University to copy virtual machines from a network drive by using the lab computer, you can do it remotely as well. This requires setting up VPN - connection to the University network. This can be acquired by following the guidelines presented here. OpenVPN software is being used.\nAfter you have successfully connected to the network, instructions are the same as here.\nInstalling the tools by yourself # This might not be always the most convenient way, but it will be the most educational. What you need to install, will vary based on the course and exercise, but general principles remain the same.\nLinux # If you are already using a Linux-based system, you can install the required packages most likely by using a system- or programming language-specific package manager, or by compiling from the source.\nYou can also use virtual machines with VirtualBox, for example, or container runner instead. We recommend Podman as container runner.\nMacOS # If you are using macOS, you can install many packages by using Homebrew or Nix or running them as containers with Docker or Podman.\nWith an ARM-based Mac, you might have some difficulties with some tools, which you cannot compile yourself. Virtualisation will be rather slow but might improve in the future.\nWindows # Only some of the tools will be directly available on Windows, but you can alternatively use Windows Subsystem for Linux instead of the full-blown virtual machine, and install in there like in regular Linux.\nOther # Good luck.\n","date":"Tuesday, February 21, 2023","permalink":"/guides/laboratories/","section":"Guides and tutorials","summary":"Laboratory assignments utilise a set of various tools which might require or target different operating systems.","title":"Laboratory environment and virtual machines"},{"content":" A collection of guides, which can be helpful in our courses.\n","date":"Sunday, January 22, 2023","permalink":"/guides/","section":"Guides and tutorials","summary":"A collection of guides, which can be helpful in our courses.","title":"Guides and tutorials"},{"content":"As digitalisation deepens and spreads to new areas of life, the need to ensure and safeguard its operations also increases.
