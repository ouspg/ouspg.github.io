This Linux distribution might have a different package manager than many have used, but it has an excellent wiki for possible problem situations and is good for learning. See Arch Linux Wiki.\nThe virtual machine has only a minimal amount of tools pre-installed in case you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough space on a hard drive. The package ecosystem is large, and the desired pre-build package will be most likely to be found if you are willing to install tools by yourself. It will also offer the latest available versions of the tools all the time.\nLook for packges from\nArch Linux main packages AUR packages(user supplied) Black Arch tools (penetration testing) All of the repositories are pre-configured.\nImage information # The image uses Gnome Desktop Environment as default and includes some core packages, e.g. browser, the code editor and some programming languages.\nUsername: arch Password: arch x86_64 Linux, Intel Macbooks, and Windows systems # Image is distributed in OVA format for x86_64 architectures. This image is intended for VirtualBox or VMware.\nVirtualBox guest additions are included. For VMware, you need to configure open-vm-tools by yourself to allow a shared clipboard and other utilities.\nOVA files can be directly imported into VirtualBox or VMware. You must configure basics, e.g. RAM and CPU core amount. At least 4GB ram and 2 cores are recommended.\nIf you face a freezing screen on the start-up in VirtualBox, change the display driver to another one.\nM1/M2 Macbooks # For ARM-based M1/M2 Macbooks, the image is distributed in qcow2 format. The ARM image uses Arch Linux ARM (unofficial) as a base, and package availability might differ for x86_64 version.\nUse UTM.\nDownload the qcow2 image and extract it. You need to create a dummy virtual machine at first (not emulation!), and then replace the empty virtual hard drive with the downloaded one.\nThe image is UEFI bootable.\nBlack Arch repositories # You can directly install Black Arch tools if you need some special ones, from the collection of 2800+ tools.\nOnly a few are preinstalled to save disk space.\nSee their tools section for available tools.\nInstalling packages # Update the package index\nsudo pacman -Sy Install package (You can look from here https://archlinux.org/packages/ for official packages and https://blackarch.org/tools.html for penetration testing tools.)\nsudo pacman -S \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; Remove package\nsudo pacman -R \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; Remove package and its dependencies\nsudo pacman -Rcns \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; Upgrade all packages\nsudo pacman -Syu Clean all the packages which have no dependencies (however, might remove something you need as well!)\nsudo pacman -Qdtq Clean package cache\nsudo pacman -Scc Installing AUR packages # Arch Linux has a large user-supplied package ecosystem, which is located in a different repository.

In practice, students will have a single regular Git repository, which will be updated during the course. Often, there will be template files, which will be filled as instructed.\nWorkflow # Enrol in the course\nFind the course\u0026rsquo;s Moodle page from University\u0026rsquo;s Moodle (https://moodle.oulu.fi/)\nFind a link where you can receive and create a private repository containing all the return template folders. You are expected to answer for given templates and store your actual work in this repository.\nCreate a GitHub account, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, and create this private repository from the link.\nYou can see the deadlines in Moodle\u0026rsquo;s return boxes. Modifications in the repositories are not restricted, but do them in time.\nComplete as many tasks as you wish and update your repository accordingly. Check the grading table found in each week\u0026rsquo;s instructions on what you have to complete to earn the grade of your choosing\nPush your changes to your repository before the deadline, and return the link to your repository to the corresponding return box of the exercise week in Moodle.\nCheck the cheat sheet if you need a refresher on how to use Git. The simple workflow to add files, mark changes and push them to remote from the command line is:\ngit add \u0026lt;/path/filename\u0026gt; git commit -m \u0026#34;\u0026lt;message\u0026gt;\u0026#34; git push You can also use the graphical interface of GitHub, but this might not be as convenient as it seems. We recommend instead installing Git for your machine, and modifying Markdown files either by using VSCode or the fully open-source version VSCodium.\nAuthentication # When using GitHub from the command line, some level of authentication is required. If you are using two-factor authentication (2FA, you should!), basic username and password authentication will not work. Instead, you either need to use SSH or PAT tokens.\nWe recommend that you use SSH keys. Follow GitHub\u0026rsquo;s tutorial over here. Especially check sections \u0026ldquo;Generating new SSH key\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Add a new SSH key\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Test your SSH connection\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/resources/github/","section":"Resources","summary":"Some courses use GitHub Classroom as a place where assignments will be returned.","title":"GitHub Classroom instructions"},{"content":"Laboratory assignments utilise a set of various tools which might require or target different operating systems. In most cases, the required system will be Linux-based, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, some steps are required.\nWe provide up-to-date and suitable virtual machines for the courses with all the required tools installed. If you have enough disk space and performance on your computer to use them, this might be the most convenient way for Windows users.\nIf you are a brave soul, you can install tools by yourself.\nProvided virtual machines # Global download links for pre-configured virtual machines can be found on the corresponding courses\u0026rsquo; Moodle page. These virtual machines are also located on the University network drive and can be accessed either locally from the classroom or with VPN.\nOperating system Description Courses Credentials Kali Linux Official Kali with extra packages Computer Security kali:kali ChipWhisperer (Jupyter) Use ChipWhisperer on Jupyter Notebook Computer Security vagrant:vagrant Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Ubuntu with only required tools Cryptographic Systems and Weaknesses crypto:crypto Arch Linux (with Black Arch repos) Minimal distribution, good documentation, any tool can be easily installed Any arch:arch Using VMs in the classroom # These instructions apply to (TS135/TS137) or any computer with VMware or Virtualbox hypervisor installed. You must be on the University premises and can access to laboratory computer which has a hypervisor installed.\nAccessing the network drive # Mount network drive by using PowerShell (If the domain \u0026lsquo;kaappi\u0026rsquo; is not found, you can use \u0026ldquo;\\cifs.isi.oulu.fi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026rdquo;)\nNew-PSDrive -Persist -Name \u0026#34;Z\u0026#34; -PSProvider \u0026#34;FileSystem\u0026#34; -Root \u0026#34;\\\\kaappi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; You should be able to find the new Z: drive named as Virtuaalikoneet$ by using File Explorer. In the Z:\\VMware, you will find virtual machines from the CyberSpecialisation folder.\nRunning the machines # You can mount the network drive as above. Copy the selected virtual machine to C:\\Temp folder. When the virtual machine asks if you have copied or moved the machine, press \u0026ldquo;I copied it\u0026rdquo;.\nGetting virtual machines over Eduroam (University WLAN) # You can mount the network drive into your PC if it has been connected to Eduroam.\nAfter you have successfully connected to the network, you can mount the network drive as follows. If any credentials are asked, the username is username@student.oulu.fi\nWindows # Open Windows cmd:\nnet use z: \u0026#34;\\\\kaappi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; The drive should be mounted after giving correct credentials. If the domain kaappi is not found, try to use the following instead:\nnet use z: \u0026#34;\\\\cifs.isi.oulu.fi\\Virtuaalikoneet$\u0026#34; Linux (Debian - based) # If you have mnt folder in the root directory, and package cifs-utils is installed, you can:\nsudo mount -t cifs //kaappi/Virtuaalikoneet$ /mnt/ -o user=username@student.oulu.fi Depending on your version, you might need to play with \u0026lsquo;sec\u0026rsquo; -variable, for example, Ubuntu 16.04 might require:\nsudo mount -t cifs //kaappi/Virtuaalikoneet$ /mnt/ -o user=username@student.oulu.fi,sec=ntlm Passwords should be prompted.\nVirtual machines are located in the Virtuaalikoneet$ drive.\nGetting virtual machines with VPN # If direct download URLs are not functioning for any reason and if you are not able to get into University to copy virtual machines from a network drive by using the lab computer, you can do it remotely as well. This requires setting up VPN - connection to the University network. This can be acquired by following the guidelines presented here. OpenVPN software is being used.\nAfter you have successfully connected to the network, instructions are the same as here.\nInstalling the tools by yourself # This might not be always the most convenient way, but it will be the most educational. What you need to install, will vary based on the course and exercise, but general principles remain the same.\nLinux # If you are already using a Linux-based system, you can install the required packages most likely by using a system- or programming language-specific package manager, or by compiling from the source.\nYou can also use virtual machines if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to educate yourself with dependency problems.\nContainer runner can be also a fast way to use some rarer command-line-based tools from Kali Linux, for example. We recommend Podman as a container runner.\nThen you can start working with Kali image as:\npodman run -it --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd):/files\u0026#34; docker.io/kalilinux/kali-rolling bash MacOS # If you are using macOS, you can install many packages by using Homebrew or Nix or running them as containers with Docker or Podman.\nWith an ARM-based Mac, you might have some difficulties with some tools, which you cannot compile yourself. Virtualisation into another instruction set will be rather slow but might improve in the future.\nWindows # Only some of the tools will be directly available on Windows, but you can alternatively use Windows Subsystem for Linux instead of the full-blown virtual machine. Then use it like a regular Linux machine.\nOther # Good luck.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/resources/laboratories/","section":"Resources","summary":"Laboratory assignments utilise a set of various tools which might require or target different operating systems.","title":"Laboratory environment and virtual machines"},{"content":"As digitalisation deepens and spreads to new areas of life, the need to ensure and safeguard its operations also increases.
